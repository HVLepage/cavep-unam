            <p>
              The C-MIEP will be a research institute aimed specifically at the study of Peruvian environmental physics. It will be physically located at the Moquegua Campus of UNAM. This institute will perform scientific research activities aimed at investigating the impact of mineral extraction on the environment, with particular reference to water resources, agro-ecology, and ecological integrity. It will operate initially in the Moquegua Region but in the long term across the whole of Peru. The first year is intended to be a pilot programme. It will include the exchange of researchers and students between UNAM and UCAM, field research, and analysis of soil, biological material, water and air using both in-situ and ex-situ techniques.
